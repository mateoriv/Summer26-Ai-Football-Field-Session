This folder is temporary and will be used for training the cnn model(s).


I assume we will want several cnn models for different aspects. 


Classification for shotgun/under center formations, leverage on wide receivers etc. 

Tensor predictions for rush/pass plays. 

To give us a headstart on this I am using play data from the NFL shhhhh.

Attached is an image showing how the NFL represents player locations.

input_2023_w[01-18].csv
The input data contains tracking data before the pass is thrown

game_id: Game identifier, unique (numeric)
play_id: Play identifier, not unique across games (numeric)
player_to_predict: whether or not the x/y prediction for this player will be scored (bool)
nfl_id: Player identification number, unique across players (numeric)
frame_id: Frame identifier for each play/type, starting at 1 for each game_id/play_id/file type (input or output) (numeric)
play_direction: Direction that the offense is moving (left or right)
absolute_yardline_number: Distance from end zone for possession team (numeric)
player_name: player name (text)
player_height: player height (ft-in)
player_weight: player weight (lbs)
player_birth_date: birth date (yyyy-mm-dd)
player_position: the player's position (the specific role on the field that they typically play)
player_side: team player is on (Offense or Defense)
player_role: role player has on play (Defensive Coverage, Targeted Receiver, Passer or Other Route Runner)
x: Player position along the long axis of the field, generally within 0 - 120 yards. (numeric)
y: Player position along the short axis of the field, generally within 0 - 53.3 yards. (numeric)
s: Speed in yards/second (numeric)
a: Acceleration in yards/second^2 (numeric)
o: orientation of player (deg)
dir: angle of player motion (deg)
num_frames_output: Number of frames to predict in output data for the given game_id/play_id/nfl_id. (numeric)
ball_land_x: Ball landing position position along the long axis of the field, generally within 0 - 120 yards. (numeric)
ball_land_y: Ball landing position along the short axis of the field, generally within 0 - 53.3 yards. (numeric)
output_2023_w[01-18].csv
The output data contains tracking data after the pass is thrown.

game_id: Game identifier, unique (numeric)
play_id: Play identifier, not unique across games (numeric)
nfl_id: Player identification number, unique across players. (numeric)
frame_id: Frame identifier for each play/type, starting at 1 for each game_id/play_id/ file type (input or output). The maximum value for a given game_id, play_id and nfl_id will be the same as the num_frames_output value from the corresponding input file. (numeric)
x: Player position along the long axis of the field, generally within 0-120 yards. (TARGET TO PREDICT)
y: Player position along the short axis of the field, generally within 0 - 53.3 yards. (TARGET TO PREDICT)
test_input.csv
Player tracking data at the same play as prediction. This file is provided only for convenience, the actual test data will be provided by the API.

test.csv
A mock test set representing the structure of the unseen test set. This file is provided only for convenience, the actual test_input data will be provided by the API. Contains the prediction targets as rows with columns (game_id, play_id, nfl_id, frame_id) representing each position that needs to be predicted.
